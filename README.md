# DL-Assignment-2-Image-Classification-with-CNN
The project involves constructing an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks for the Fashion MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images representing 10 distinct clothing categories. Through the implementation of a CNN architecture in Python, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the goal is to train a model that accurately classifies fashion items such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers. The script normalizes pixel values, defines the model architecture, compiles it with appropriate parameters, and trains it over multiple epochs. The resulting model is then evaluated on a test set, and the training history is visualized to assess its performance. The project not only provides a practical introduction to image classification but also offers room for further exploration, including hyperparameter tuning and deployment considerations for real-world applications.
